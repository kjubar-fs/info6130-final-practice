Sample practice app for the Android dev final.
Uses view binding, MVVM, LiveData, Fragments, Firebase Auth, Repository, Room DB, and Retrofit.

Persists word list in local storage via Room and associates it by user ID, so different users have different lists.

Valid credentials to log in are `bob@abc.com / user1234` or `k_jubar@fanshaweonline.ca / user1234`.
